Hi Lev,
  
    All feedback is extremely welcome! I tried to be more conscious of using & re-using classes...and tried 
    not to repeat myself too much! I think I am starting to wrap my head around using classes and id's -id's
    giving the element or the class that "one time aspect".
    
    Question - I defined a couple of margins inline - it just seemed easier rather than try and position every single 
    little thing universally in the css file. Is this okay? or is it terrible?
    
    Thanks!!
    Christina
